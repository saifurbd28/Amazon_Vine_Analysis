# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
# Background

This project aim is to analyze a dataset from the Amazon Vine program (https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) using PySpark for ETL performing and dataset extraction, followed by AWS RDS instance connection and loading the transformed data into pgAdmin. Additionally, it is to make sure whether this dtat has any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members using PySpark, Panadas, or SQL.

# Results
# Deliverable-1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews

# Deliverable-2:
## How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
    

## How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?



## What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

# Summary
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
